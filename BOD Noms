<div class="panel-body">
<strong>Biography</strong>
<ol>I am a 20-year industry veteran and currently a Senior Regional Facilities Manager for Walmart Stores Inc. My current fiscal responsibility is $150 million dollars with oversight of 400+ locations regionally. During my six year tenure with Walmart Stores Inc., I have advanced to my fourth consecutive level of operational responsibility and impact. My career in Facilities Management has led to successful advancement and growth with each new role. I have a successful track record that includes spearheading positive change across all assigned areas, including fiscal, logistical and operations. My areas of expertise include capital and operational expense management and identifying and implementing strategic initiatives. I am currently the Co-Chair of the PRSM Conference Committee and have previously served on the PRSM Mid-Year Committee.</ol>
<ol></ol>
<strong>Candidate Statement </strong>
<ol>I am honored and excited to be nominated to serve on the PRSM Board of Directors. I have been a member of PRSM since 2008 and truly believe that PRSM plays a key role as a resource for both Retailers and Vendors. I bring to the board over 20 years' experience in retail facilities management. I have had the fortune to gain my knowledge and experience from advancement; with each step a larger, more challenging opportunity within retail companies of different types and sizes. Over my career, I have been instrumental in implementing strategic initiatives that leverage my "out of the box" thinking and industry experience to effect change within an organization. As a member of the Mid-Year Committee for several years, I have been given the opportunity to see how individuals are able to effect change within PRSM. My goal in becoming a member of the board is to help the organization continue to develop a strategy that grows the member base while leveraging the existing members to become a more impactful partner to the industry. I believe that the recent changes within PRSM position us to effect change quicker and to be more nimble in our ability to shift focus as needed. I will also help foster a closer relationship between the Retailers and Vendors that allows us to work together to improve the overall conference experience. This is an exciting time to be a member of PRSM!</ol>

<strong>Candidate Statement </strong>
<ol>I would be honored to have your support and ask for your vote in the upcoming election to select our newest Board of Directors. I have been an active member of PRSM since I joined the retail world more than a decade ago. PRSM has done so much for me over the years, offering educational and networking opportunities, allowing me to meet and build quality relationships with my facilities peers and industry-leading vendors. PRSM also provides an avenue for us to give back, whether that be sitting on committees, publishing articles or presenting at conferences. As you may recall, I recently served on the board and was honored to also serve as your President for the 2014-2015 term. During that time, we were highly effective and made great progress, including setting plans into motion to transition to the new governance model that we operate under today. In the years since I have dropped off the board I have stayed engaged serving on work groups and task forces, but I do miss the day to day involvement and contribution opportunities that board service afforded me. It is my hope to return to the board, witness the progression and results from our previous efforts and continue to contribute my time and efforts to PRSM at the highest level possible. Thank you for your consideration.</ol>

</div>
<div class="panel-collapse collapse" data-parent="#dg-acc16" id="dg-16-3">
<div class="panel-body">
<strong>Biography</strong>
<ol>When I saw an opportunity to work with a beverage alcohol retailer I thought it would be an interesting step in my early career. That was 20 years ago and the LCBO (Liquor Control Board of Ontario) is still a progressive government retailer that has offered the growth and challenges I have undertaken to develop and now succeed in the role of the Director of Facilities, Environmental and Safety.</ol>
<ol>Over my entire work life, I have been an employee on the front line in warehousing, customer service and on the retail floor. My education is in architectural technology and facilities management. I have undertaken retail store design and construction roles, hands-on retail maintenance projects, procurement and progressive leadership positions.</ol>
<ol>Growing up in a farming community I learned to recognize the value of being part of a team working toward greater goals and to overcome challenges. This enhanced my ability to problem solve, the desire to help a neighbor and to look for help, to get my hands dirty, and importantly to gather and celebrate.</ol>
<ol>These values I impart to my two teenage boys as well as being core to my leadership style. Outside of the office and with active kids we enjoy travel, skiing, golf, hockey and time with extended family.</ol>
<ol></ol>
<strong>Candidate Statement </strong>
<ol>PRSM provides a welcome support to those of us in an ever-changing industry and I have sought to get further involved since joining. I enjoyed my time with the Canadian Committee and my role on the Benchmarking Committee and look ahead to the opportunity to have a greater role as a member of the Board of Directors. As a potential Board member, I believe I could bring a unique perspective to the Association. I belong to a government retailer that mandate is to sell its products in a socially responsible manner, efficiently, along with significant levels of transparency, a large retail union, and geography that serves one of the largest metropolitan cities in North America to some of the remotest communities. Like all retailers, our brick and mortar competition has increased along with e-commerce. Recently, a part of our business is now embarking on retailing recreation cannabis. Being a member of the Board would be a privilege, and I would be pleased to share my knowledge and experience and to continue to learn from the PRSM community. There is unlimited potential in our member partnerships and our combined knowledge to continue to develop our profession and to be seen as a significant component of the retail landscape.</ol>

</div>
<div class="panel-collapse collapse" data-parent="#dg-acc16" id="dg-16-4">
<div class="panel-body">Biography
<ol>I often like to ask other Retail Facility Managers how they got into this business. Their answers are often varied, but always interesting. We come from all different backgrounds and levels of experience, training, education and business acumen. My first experience in retail was as a small, independent contractor doing work for Gap in the New York City area. Eventually, a position opened with Gap Inc. in California to manage the Store Maintenance Department responsible for about 750 stores. The company had aggressive growth plans back then, and I had a steep learning curve. I had to quickly ramp up my skills as well as build my team and vendor base, develop processes and performance standards and create budgets to support this growth. Most importantly, I learned the importance of building good relationships with field operations and sharing my strategic plan to gain their confidence. PRSM helped me develop new ways of thinking, identify opportunities and new ideas for continuous improvement and helped me meet my new challenges. With the valuable relationships and information that PRSM made available to me, I was able to continue to grow and develop in my career. Over time, I took on various roles with other large multi-brand retailers, Bath &amp; Body Works and Limited Brands, responsible for Store Maintenance as well as Store Operations, Store Planning and Energy and Environmental Services. I am currently responsible for the Repairs &amp; Maintenance of over 4,000 Luxottica stores in North America (e.g. LensCrafters, Oakley, Pearle Vision, Sunglass Hut). In addition, several years ago, I earned my MBA degree and more recently earned the credentials of LEED Green Associate. I have also been very involved with the PRSM Green Council as Chair, and presently as Co-Chair of the PRSM Sustainability Council.</ol>
<ol></ol>
<strong>Candidate Statement </strong>
<ol>I've been involved with PRSM since its inception. In the time before PRSM, there wasn't much opportunity to network and share best practices with other Retail Facility Managers, but we slowly started to develop a network of colleagues, many of whom were looking for answers to similar questions. The concept of PRSM developed back then from the essential needs of us Retail Facility Managers, and as I see it today, the current purpose of PRSM is still based on similar needs. The foundation at the core of the organization remains the same, to meet the needs of its members, to educate and enhance our skills, build our knowledge base, share best practices and support each other. We need to continue to support an ever new, vital and enthusiastic set of Retail Facility Managers coming to PRSM looking to network and develop their skills and knowledge. It has been my privilege to see PRSM develop over time into the highly respected organization that it is today. I've seen the importance of the members serving and supporting the organization, giving back where possible. As PRSM continues to create the future of the retail facilities industry, it is important for us to ensure that the organization will be there to support FM's like us for a long time to come. I would like to ask for your vote and for the opportunity to become a member of the PRSM Board of Directors. My commitment to you is to represent you, serve your needs as PRSM members and help build the organization to meet the needs of PRSM members well into the future.</ol>

<div class="panel-body"><strong>Biography</strong>
<ol>I have been working in retail for over 25 years, both as a retailer and a vendor, and I believe the dual experience gives me a unique perspective on the challenges faced by both. In my current position as Director of Facilities for TD Bank, I am responsible for the strategic direction and daily operation of the facilities department for almost 1,500 locations. When I am not working, I am spending time with my beautiful bride of more than 20 years, Jennifer, the center of my universe, and all that I do can be traced back to my family and my desire to provide for them and be the best husband or father that I can be. I was born, raised and still reside in New Jersey, but I graduated with a degree in Secondary Education from the University of Arizona. I would describe myself as an imperfect, resilient, competitive and compassionate person, and believe that my strengths focus on relationships, partnerships, leadership, integrity and team building. My interests include coaching my kid's sports teams, playing ice hockey, running marathons, building things and volunteering my time to help others. When I have been asked why I do the volunteer work that I do, I answer, "It makes me feel good to help someone else feel good." I endeavor to apply in my life every day, the same five qualities that I try to instill in the kids I am blessed to coach: Smile, Have Fun, Hustle, Listen, Be a good teammate.</ol>
<ol></ol>
<strong>Candidate Statement </strong>
<ol>This past year of service on the board has reinforced my commitment to the vital work the organization does in bringing people in our industry together for the benefit of all parties. I have been a PRSM member since 2010 and during that time I have served on multiple committees - Ethics, Audit and Investment, Member Advisory and Charity, to name a few. In addition, I co-chaired the Mid-Year conference task force for two years and have been a speaker at the mid-year conference. Last April, I was lucky to be elected as one of the two retail alternates to the Board. I am honored and humbled to once again be nominated, which wouldn't have been possible without the help of so many members of PRSM, who over the years have shared their knowledge and experience with me, supporting and mentoring me. As someone that places a premium upon relationships, partnerships and teamwork, I am proud of all that PRSM does to further the development of those dynamic qualities that are so integral to the success of our industry. So much more can be accomplished when individuals work together than when a person or business goes it alone. So I commit to you today, that if elected again I will continue to focus on those three qualities to help PRSM excel in providing an environment that helps all parties: * Create and grow relationships, * Support and strengthen existing partnerships, and be conducive to creating new ones, * Foster a setting that is even more inclusive and supportive of teamwork. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I'm grateful for the opportunity to give back, and through teamwork, help build upon the strong foundation put in place by previous boards. I would greatly appreciate your support and ask for both your vote AND your partnership, in the coming years in assisting our PRSM Teams' growth from good to GREAT!</ol>

</div>
<div class="panel-collapse collapse" data-parent="#dg-acc16" id="dg-16-7">
<div class="panel-body"><strong>Biography</strong>
<ol>After 15 years in sales and management positions, I started Authority HVAC in 2006. When we started the company, we had no prospects, customers or name recognition. It took three years of PRSM conferences to get a retailer to stop by our booth! After months of effort, we found a few small retail chains that were either willing to take a chance on us or didn't know any better. Utilizing a "fair price, exceptional service" philosophy, we continued adding retailers who were frustrated with call-center business models. My experience encompasses every aspect of business operation - strategic planning, go-to-market, service enhancement, human capital development, financial capital development, sales/marketing and company culture. Today the company has over 40 employees and approximately 45 retail customers, most of whom are long-term relationships. I have been a PRSM member since the inception of the company, have served on the Membership Committee and have sponsored multiple PRSM events. In addition to the PRSM national conference, I have been a consistent attendee at Mid-Year and regional PRSM Live events. Locally, I volunteer with an organization called the Executive Council, which services as a fundraising auxiliary for youth charities in Phoenix. I also volunteer coach for my children's sports teams. I received a B.S. in Business Administration from the University of Southern California in 1992. In my spare time, I try to keep up with my wife (Brette) and our three children (Tripp, Riley, and Dylan).</ol>
<ol></ol>
<strong>Candidate Statement </strong>
<ol>Our industry is at an inflection point that offers both genuine threats and genuine opportunities. Online shopping has eliminated retail chains that were unable to adapt, but there are also a lot of success stories with retail chains that succeeded at adapting. My singular objective as a PRSM Board Member is to foster more adaptivity- at the Board level, the staff level, and the membership level. We need to become more adept at disseminating these success stories across our membership and building a better collective knowledge base. We have built up good assets in this area- Retailer2Retailer, PRSM LIVE, and Best Practice Forums have transformed this education process from what used to be mostly Education Sessions at the conferences. However, we still have untapped opportunities to improve these assets further through social media, mobile and other avenues that are utilized by younger professionals. Another opportunity to adapt is to build more professional development among the vendor community. PRSM has an unbelievably hard-working vendor community, but competitive pressures often hinder building genuine collaborations between retailers and vendors. We have had some successful vendor-oriented Education Sessions in the past, but we can put a lot more effort into providing meaningful curriculum for vendors. Our vendor community (and I humbly include Authority HVAC here) need help to become more patient, learn how to listen better, and more adaptive ourselves. The future success of our industry will certainly depend on it. I hope to receive your support and continue building this great organization!</ol>

<strong>Biography</strong>
<ol>After college, Jaclyn was hired as a Field Representative for a Central California Congressman. This is where she was able to grow her public relations skills, develop engagement strategies, perfect crisis management and complex decision-making. Soon after, Jaclyn was recruited by a Washington consulting firm and the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) to lead a multimillion-dollar campaign in Northern California. Jaclyn rose to the occasion and lead a PAC (political action committee) through an ambitious campaign that was victorious in the end. At 23, those seven months were some of the most educational of her career, providing her with experience, skills and qualities that can only be developed in a challenging and tumultuous environment. Those skills were coveted by the Building Industry Association, and Jaclyn joined their ranks as the Director of Governmental Affairs. For five years, Jaclyn established and implemented the association's political engagement strategy through negotiation with federal, state and locally-elected officials, regulatory agencies and policymakers. By partnering with consultancy agencies (for strategic development) and working with legal teams for legislative positioning, Jaclyn was able to positively affect regulatory change. Jaclyn was approached by the owner of American Facilities Maintenance, whom she had known throughout her tenure with the BIA, and was offered a position with an opportunity with long-term growth in the private sector. In 2009, Jaclyn accepted the position as Operations and Marketing Director. In 2012, after launching several operational and strategic initiatives, Jaclyn made Partner and in 2014 was promoted to Vice President of Development &amp; Operations. While she is passionate about Facilities Management, she also enjoys reading, being outdoors, laughing and traveling with her husband and two children.</ol>

<strong>Candidate Statement </strong>
<ol>Not many can deny my enthusiasm for the PRSM Association. Since joining in 2009, my involvement has been synonymous with my professional growth and leadership within the industry. I am a firm believer that, "The direct output of one's endeavors is dependent on the input." Meaning, I can't fail if I dedicate my time and energy to something. This includes the PRSM Association. PRSM has provided me an opportunity to learn and grow, but I had to be willing to put in the time and effort. From volunteering on the Membership Committee to then Chairing the Networking and Membership Committee's, and then sitting on the Tools Task Force and Benchmarking Committees, I have lived this testament firsthand! The Association and FM Industry are at a pivotal moment in time, where technology and retail are converging to enhance user (and customer) experiences. I look forward to enthusiastically working with the Board, Staff and all Members to help navigate the Association into the future of FM. I not only ask for your vote, but I ask for an opinion, too! I want to work together, listen, learn, and ultimately provide guidance that will enhance all of our experiences as PRSM Members. #LetsVOTE</ol>

My first corporate job was teaching others at College Pro Painters how to do the same thing: recruiting them, teaching them marketing and sales, as well as production, finances and customer service. After developing College Pro franchises all over PA, NJ and NY, I left to join a much larger company, AAMCO Transmissions, where I ultimately became director of Operations for all 700 locations across North America. In 2005, I joined CertaPro Painters and while serving as Vice President of Franchise Development, helped grow their footprint from 140 to 450 locations. I am a proud father of two wonderful daughters and married to a lovely wife for the past 20 years. I sit on the board of a charitable foundation for suicide prevention, and I am the head coach of two girls' softball teams.</ol>

<strong>Candidate Statement </strong>
<ol>My name is Steve Hearon, and I'm writing to ask for your vote in my quest to become a Board member of PRSM. It was an honor to be nominated, and I take the opportunity to represent my fellow retail suppliers seriously. I have experience serving on boards such as this one, and I know how important collaboration and communication are to leverage the wisdom and experience of all the members. I believe PRSM should 1) be the premier platform for sharing best practices among retail maintenance professionals, 2) be a powerhouse of networking resources, and 3) be a place to go for information and education to enable self-improvement among its members. I feel my experience in leading companies, as well as volunteer associations, will be quite valuable. One of my core values is continuous improvement, and I feel everyone should be a constant learner in order to become a top performer. I derive great satisfaction from working on and with teams, leading teams and helping people achieve their goals. I've accumulated some amazing relationships in the world of retail, and I pride myself in facilitating win/win connections among others. If you vote for me, I can assure you I will commit the time, energy and passion required to make a difference. Thank you for your consideration.</ol>

</div>
<div class="panel-collapse collapse" data-parent="#dg-acc16" id="dg-16-12">
<div class="panel-body"><strong>Biography</strong>
<ol>Bill Lisowski has spent over 25 years in the retail facilities industry as a merchant, store operations manager, in national facilities for a Big Box retailer, an industry consultant and in leadership roles for several facilities service providers. It is this experience and rounded perspective that has served him throughout his career. He began in the retail trenches, managing three men's divisions for a specialty retailer, before taking over a leadership role handling the day-to-day operations of running a $30 mil store. Bill then moved into a national facilities role, handling the execution of a $77 mil annual capital replacement budget and supporting a 2,000-person field organization with an annual facilities budget near $750 mil. On the vendor side, Bill led facility maintenance teams of up to 100 employees, developing more efficient and customer-centric processes and teams. Rounding out his work experiences, Bill has owned his own service business, been a journalist, and co-authored three books on leadership and entry-level management. He has also volunteered 12 years with his college's alumni association, leading the group as President, Vice President, and chairperson of various committees. Currently, he is Co-Chair of the PRSM Editorial Committee. When asked which of his accomplishments stand out the most, Bill will always talk about the number of people he has mentored and helped to grow, with many of them earning promotions or enhancing their businesses. To him, that will always be one of his major hallmarks of success.</ol>

<strong>Candidate Statement </strong>
<ol>A training class I conduct for all of my entry level leaders is called "Recognizing People as Assets" because I feel this is the essential perspective all successful organizations must have, and it is a philosophy all successful leaders need. PRSM's members and leaders are its fundamental strength, and it has been exciting to see this growth over the past 15 years. I would like to help make this an even stronger asset of PRSM. I see PRSM as a key resource for developing people within our industry, from giving entry-level FMs basic information about our craft to helping seasoned managers understand new perspectives affecting their daily responsibilities. I want to push for even more emphasis on the nuances and unasked (and sometimes controversial) questions to help our membership recognize trends quicker, to be even more prepared for the quickened pace of change. PRSM has grown in stature within the industry and continues to take steps to establish itself as the premier organization for retail facilities maintenance. I would like to bring my perspectives of having worked as a merchant, retail facilities manager and a facilities vendor to the dialogue as our Board of Directors enhances the pathway to the future. Thank you for considering me for the PRSM Board of Directors. I believe I can bring strong and unique perspectives into the dialogue. I ask you for your vote.</ol>
